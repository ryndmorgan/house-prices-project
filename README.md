# house-prices-project
This repository contains a notebook and various files related to a model which predicts house prices.

This is a beginner data science project based on the [Kaggle House Price Prediction project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview), which I worked on in August 2024.

The [presentation](ryndmorgan/house-prices-project/house_prices_linear_regression.pptx) contains more information about the project.
